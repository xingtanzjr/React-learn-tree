## Tree Style Tab
A tree style tab navigator

**PIN your extension and press 'Alt + Q' to open the extension swiftly**, enhancing your browsing experience!

### Introduction
This Chrome/Edge extension is aimed to solve a very simple but annoying problem, that is, how to switch to the tab you want quickly in lots of opened tabs.

What the extension different from others is that it gives a **tree-style list** for tabs. This tree separates all tabs into different groups by the relationship between the child-tab and their parent-tab, which gives you a better insight for all the tabs. All the tabs opened by same tab will become the children of the tab which opens them.

### New-Features
